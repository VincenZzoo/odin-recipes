    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p> This Disaronno Fizz is a refreshing and easy-to-make cocktail that combines the nutty and sweet flavor of <strong>amaretto liqueur with fizzy soda bubbles.</strong> It's the perfect drink to enjoy on a warm summer day or at any other time when you want something light, refreshing, and delicious. <strong>It requires just a few simple ingredients and minimal effort</strong>.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Amaretto is a sweet almond-flavored liqueur thatâ€™s perfect for cocktails. Look for a high-quality brand such as Disaronno, which has a distinct nutty and sweet flavor and is widely available at most liquor stores. </li>
        <li>Lemon juice is used in the classic cocktail, Amaretto Sour, to balance the sweetness of the amaretto and to add a fresh, citrusy flavor to the cocktail. It does the same for an Amaretto Fizz. Use a squeeze of fresh lemon juice rather than bottled juice, which will taste much better in this cocktail. </li>
        <li>Soda water adds a bubbly and effervescent quality to the drink, as well as a subtle flavor that compliments the amaretto liqueur. </li>
        <li>Garnish with lemon and maraschino cocktail cherries. This will add a pop of color and a burst of flavor to the drink. When using maraschino cocktail cherries, make sure to opt for a high quality one, like Luxardo, instead of the bright red cheap maraschino cherries. </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Add the Disaronno amaretto to a cocktail shaker.</li>
        <li>Add the lemon juice.</li>
        <li>Add ice cubes to the shaker and shake until well chilled.</li>
        <li>Strain into a cocktail glass.</li>
        <li>Top with soda water.</li>
        <li>Garnish with cherries and a lemon slice, if desired.</li>
    </ol>
