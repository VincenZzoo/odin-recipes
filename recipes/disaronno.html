        <li>1 medium red onion, chopped</li>
        <li>1 red bell pepper, chopped small</li>
        <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>(1) 15-ounce can black beans, drained and rinsed</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups uncooked short grain brown rice</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups corn (frozen, fresh or canned)</li>
        <li>1 cup finely chopped kale</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large pot with a lid, add the olive oil and warm over medium heat. Add the chopped onion, red pepper and garlic and saute for 2-3 minutes, stirring constantly.</li>
        <li>Now add the beans, rice, corn, kale, salsa, water, spices and salt. Stir, then turn the heat to high and bring to a boil. Lower the heat, place the lid on and simmer for about 45 minutes until the rice is cooked. Remove from heat and let the mixture sit for an additional 10 minutes. Now stir the mixture and serve.</li>
        <li>Press the saute function on the Instant Pot and warm the olive oil in the inner pot. Add the onion, red pepper and garlic and saute for 2-3 minutes. Turn off the Instant Pot for a moment. Add a few tablespoons of water and scrape any stuck pieces of vegetables to de-glaze the pot and prevent a burn message.</li>
        <li>Now add all the remaining burrito filling ingredients to Instant Pot, give it a little stir, place the lid on, turn valve to seal and set to high pressure for 24 minutes. Let pressure release naturally (usually this takes about 10 minutes). Carefully remove the lid and stir.</li>
        <li>Spoon some of the mixture into the centers of the tortillas. Add whatever additional toppings you'd like such as vegan sour cream, vegan cheese shreds, lettuce, etc. Fold two sides over the filling and roll up. Enjoy!</li>
