    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>If you know what poutine is, chances are you've either been to Montreal or you know someone who is from or who has been to Montreal. Poutine is a specialty of Quebec (the Canadian province that Montreal is part of), and is typically made of beef gravy, fresh cheese curds and French fries. Obviously, we can't use beef gravy and kosher cheese curds are not easy to come by, so in the kosher versions, it is made with shredded cheese and some sort of pareve imitation beef gravy or onion gravy. </p>
    <p>We Montrealers are ridiculously proud of our authentic poutine! We get excited and oooh and ahh simply over the mention of the word! Interestingly, the first time I tried it, I was extremely grossed out. I was a little girl and my brother convinced me to buy it when we were at the pizza shop together. I didn’t like the gooey cheese mixed with the gravy. To me, fries were meant to be fries—don’t mess with a good thing. </p>
    <p>Over the years, my taste changed and evolved, and now I think poutine is the best thing ever! Poutine is an incredibly delicious comfort food and the combination of gravy, cheese and hot fries is perfection! I dream of going home to visit my parents so I can order the cheesy, saucy dish. It’s so good, I almost feel like I wasted all those years growing up in Montreal and not eating it!</p>
    <p>Once I was old enough to appreciate it, I would eat poutine on cold Montreal winter Motza’ei Shabbosos when I went out with friends. And the night of my engagement party, I told my husband not to eat anything fleishig because as soon as the vort was over, I dragged him to the pizza shop to savor his first poutine! </p>
